## Introduction

The data is gathered from English Premier League matches from 2023/2024 season. The data contains information about the teams, goals scored, and the match outcome. The data is taken from the [Football Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mertbayraktar/english-premier-league-matches-20232024-season) website. The data is in CSV format and contains 456 rows and 28 columns. 

I am interested in finding out the following:

- The relationship between goals scored and the possession held by the teams. 
- The relationship between the formation and possession.

## Primary Visualizations

```{r}

ggplot(matches, aes(x = Poss, y = GF)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Goals vs Possession",
       x = "Possession",
       y = "Goals")

```

```{r}

ggplot(matches, aes(x = Formation, y = Poss)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(title = "Formation vs Possession",
       x = "Formation",
       y = "Possession")


```
