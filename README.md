# Data Visualization Journey - Spring 2024

## Welcome to My Data Visualization Blog Repository 

Hello! I'm Rodrick Mpofu, a Junior Data Science major, and this repository is an extension of my Data Visualization class project for Spring 2024. Here, you'll find the code, datasets, and resources that fuel the visual stories and insights shared on my blog.

About This Project As part of my academic journey and passion for data science, I've embarked on a quest to explore and master the art of data visualization. This repository serves as a central hub where I share the technical backbone behind the captivating visuals on my blog. From raw data to final charts and insightful graphs, it's all here for you to explore, learn, and perhaps contribute to.
