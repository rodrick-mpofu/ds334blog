The teams are ordered by the average goals to xG ratio. A ratio greater than 1 indicates that a team is overperforming their xG, while a ratio less than 1 indicates that a team is underperforming their xG. The plot shows that some teams are overperforming their xG, while others are underperforming. Most surprising is that the team with the highest ratio is not the team currently leading the league. This suggests that the team leading the league may not be the most efficient in front of goal. Luton Town only promoted to the Premier League this season and are currently leading the league. They have the highest goals to xG ratio, which suggests that they are overperforming their xG."

    "text": "Conclusion\nThe analysis has shown that possession percentage is positively correlated with match results. Teams with higher possession percentages tend to win more matches. The analysis also showed that there is a positive correlation between expected goals (xG) and actual goals scored (GF). This means that teams with higher xG tend to score more goals. The analysis also showed that some teams are overperforming their xG, while others are underperforming. This suggests that some teams are more efficient in front of goal than others. The team leading the league is not the most efficient in front of goal, as they are underperforming their xG. I would like to further investigate the goals to xG ratio for each team in different seasons to see if the efficiency in front of goal is consistent across seasons. I would also like to investigate the relationship between possession percentage and formations to see if certain formations are more effective in controlling possession. I would argue that my visualizations are effective in communicating the relationships between possession percentage, xG, and match results. The boxplot effectively shows the relationship between possession percentage and match results. The scatter plot effectively shows the relationship between xG and GF. The lollipop plot effectively shows the efficiency in front of goal for each team. All the plots are not cluttered and are easy to interpret. There have a low data-ink ratio and are not misleading."

I’m Rodrick, a Junior Data Science major, deeply immersed in the fascinating world of transforming complex data into insightful and accessible visual stories.\nMy academic path has nurtured a profound appreciation for the power of data visualization, not just as a tool for analysis but as a bridge connecting data with real-world impact. This blog serves as my digital canvas, where I’ll be sharing my projects, learnings, and the occasional epiphany, aiming to demystify data visualization techniques for my peers and anyone interested in making data more digestible.\nOutside the realm of numbers and charts, you can catch me on the soccer field or unwinding with my favorite tunes. I believe in balancing the rigor of data science with the joy of personal passions.\nI invite you to join me on this visual exploration of data, where we’ll uncover the stories hidden within numbers. Your insights and feedback are not just welcomed but encouraged. Together, let’s dive into the world of data visualization and discover the beauty in data."

The boxplot shows the median, quartiles, and the range of the price for each locality. The boxplot shows that Manhattan has the highest median price, followed by Brooklyn and Staten Island. Queens and the Bronx have the lowest median price. The boxplot also shows the presence of outliers in each locality, which are represented by the dots outside the whiskers of the boxplot."

It appears that Manhattan (as inferred by the shape of the island) and certain parts of Long Island have the highest property prices."

    "section": "Conclusion",
    "text": "Conclusion\nThe analysis of the New York City property dataset has provided insights into the distribution of property prices across different localities and types of houses. The analysis has shown that Manhattan has the highest median property prices across almost all types of housing statuses, while The Bronx and Staten Island often have the lowest. The geographical distribution of property prices has shown that Manhattan and certain parts of Long Island have the highest property prices. This analysis can be used by real estate investors, property developers, and potential homebuyers to make informed decisions about property investments in New York City. I would like to further investigate the relationship between the price of the house and the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, and the area of the house. I would also like to investigate the relationship between the price of the house and the year it was built. This will help to provide more insights into the factors that influence property prices in New York City. I would argue that my visualizations are effective in communicating the insights from the dataset. The boxplot and lolliplot are effective in showing the distribution of property prices across different localities and types of houses. The geographical heatmap is effective in showing the geographical distribution of property prices across New York City. The visualizations are clear, concise, and easy to understand, and they effectively communicate the insights from the dataset. The color choices and the use of a logarithmic scale in the visualizations are effective in highlighting the differences in property prices across different localities and types of houses."
